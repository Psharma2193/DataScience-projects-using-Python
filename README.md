# DataScience-projects-using-Python
Data Science projects repository using Python and ML techniques

The repository include the projects I've been part of throughout my academic career as a Graduate student specializing in Data Analytics track.

**Project 1 (Beginner) - Gym Usage Analysis**
This project was not part of curricullum requirements, but I did this to start off data analysis in python using a dataset. 
This helped me understand my way around data exploration and visualization in Jupyter notebook.

**Project 2(Intermediate) - Kaggle survey Analysis**
Analyzed Machine learning concepts in Python for examining Kaggle data survey dataset to get comprehensive view of state of Data Science across the globe
Analysis lead to interesting findings on how new data scientists can best enter field, and in the process we found insights that helped in breaking the myth around salaries

**Project 3(Intermediate) - COMPAS Recidivism Analysis**
Mined COMPAS data using Python to examine accuracy of algorithm and assess whether it was biased towards certain groups
Explored Machine Learning models by developing SVM, Random forest and various other classification models to predict recidivism rates of defendants; performed model selection on statistical metrics and visualized results with Python packages
